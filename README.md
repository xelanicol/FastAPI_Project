This Repository contains the code used for the FastAPI project in the course Python API Development - Comprehensive Course for Beginners by FreeCodeCamp.org, delivered by Sanjeev Thiyagarajan. 

I followed the video to create this code - so it will be very similar to that shown in the video with some minor differences and extra comments.

I used git to periodically commit changes to get in the habit of keeping records / transparent code
